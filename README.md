# Book Library Program
In the process of creating a program that displays books and book completion

I'm trying to create a program that will display books that the user has read or is currently reading. I plan to make it so that the user can enter the total page numbers of a book and the amount of pages that have been read. Using these variables, the program will output a percentage of completion and sort the books by that percentage. I am currently using java.util.HashMap to display four pre-determined books, but I plan to allow the user to enter the name of a book as well.
